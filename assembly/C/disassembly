# Disassembly Showcase

This repository demonstrates the compilation → assembly → disassembly workflow for small C programs.
It is intended as an educational portfolio piece for low-level programming, reverse engineering, and systems understanding.

## Contents
- `src/`: original C sources
- `build/`: compiled binaries and disassembly outputs
- `analysis/`: textual analysis and notes (line-by-line explanations)
- `README_FR-CA.md`: French (Canadian) translation

## How to reproduce locally
1. `gcc -O0 -g -o build/sum src/sum.c`
2. `objdump -d -M intel build/sum > build/sum.disasm`

## Why this matters
Employers value developers who know how code becomes machine instructions. This repo shows ability in C, compilation flags, and binary analysis.
